# Brief Project Description

It was nice working on this mini project. It has taken me about 9 days to submit this though it took about 4 to 5 days to work on it as 
I had a tight schedule during this period. Hardest part to implement? Not sure I will use the word "hard" but basically, state management 
always has it's own added complexities (I made use of NgRx). Functionalities I'm proud of? Probably State management, lol.

I do hope you like what I have done.

Sidenote: while this was generated with Angular CLI 7.3.8 as it says below, I did upgrade it to the latest Release Candidate which is version
8. Prefer the lazy loading syntax and wanted to try out some of the improvements as well.

# Client
